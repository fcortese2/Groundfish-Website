# Welcome to DBTools
## Made by Filippo Cortese

DBTools is a unity plugin which enables runtime virtual database creation in Unity. Writing, reading and interacting with the virtual database.

### How to use

Once you have imported the package into your Unity project, firstly you can add all of the objects (only Serializable Objects) to the *INCLUDED OBJECTS* section of the inspector int the *DBTools -- Settings* object found in the hierarchy view.

After adding the items, you must specify which fields will be included in the virtual database. You can do so by clicking the *+* button under the *DATABASE FIELDS* section of the same inspector. If the field name has been entered correctly, a tick will appear next to the entry. If it has not been entered correctly, an error message and a cross will appear, as well as play mode exiting as soon as you try to enter play mode in-engine. Please remember to specify the datatype of the field correctly.

The only available datatypes are currently `string`, `int`, `float` and `bool`.

Should you need to add further fields to the database which cannot be converted to a basic type such as `int`, `float`, `bool` and `string`, navigate to the scene object called *DBTools -- Reflector*. In this object's inspector window, proceed to select one of the following types from the drop-down menu : `Texture2D`, `Sprite` or `GameObject`. Currently these are the only unity-specific types which can be stored in the virtual database, but more will be added at a later stage.
