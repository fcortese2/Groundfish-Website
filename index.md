# Welcome to DBTools
## Made by Filippo Cortese

DBTools is a unity plugin which enables runtime virtual database creation in Unity. Writing, reading and interacting with the virtual database.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### How to use

Once you have imported the package into your Unity project, firstly you can add all of the objects (only Serializable Objects) to the *INCLUDED OBJECTS* section of the inspector int the *DBTools -- Settings* object found in the hierarchy view.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fcortese2/Groundfish-Website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
